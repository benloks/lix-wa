### Sgaw Karen onscreen keyboard
This is a simple web page that allows people to type in S'gaw Karen using the "lix wa" (Myanmar) script.
Works best on desktop.

### Code, fonts, etc.
+ On-screen virtual keyboard from [Mottie/Keyboard](https://github.com/Mottie/Keyboard)
+ Basic keyboard layout derived from [Drum Publications](http://www.drumpublications.org/download/knufontmap.jpg) and [Ben01/kanyawtypist](https://github.com/Ben01/kanyawtypist), with input from the [Foundation for Applied Linguistics](http://www.thai-fal.org)
+ Font used is [Padauk](http://software.sil.org/padauk/) from SIL - a Unicode-compliant font family
+ For users of Firefox, this site also displays [Padauk's language-specific glyphs](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=projects&item_id=graphite_fontdemo) for S'gaw Karen. Graphite must be enabled for this to work. For other browsers, this site uses the standard Burmese forms.
