		<p>This on-screen keyboard is designed for typing in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%27gaw_Karen_language">S'gaw Karen</a>, a language spoken in Thailand and Myanmar. Many S'gaw Karen people use "lix wa" characters to write their language, which is included in the Myanmar Unicode range. However, Burmese fonts and keyboards often do not fully support the additional characters (U+1061, U+1062, U+1063, and U+1064) that are used in S'gaw Karen but not used in standard Burmese. That makes it difficult to write in Karen online.</p>
		<p>By typing in this on-screen keyboard, S'gaw Karen users can write their language using the proper Unicode codepoints assigned for the lix wa script.<p>
		<p><b>How to use the on-screen keyboard :</b> Set your keyboard to English (QWERTY) and start typing. Or, just click on the letter you want. You can then copy and paste your text into another program.</p>
		<p><b>Fonts :</b> Lix wa characters for Sgaw Karen are included in the Myanmar Unicode set, but not all fonts support the language completely. On this page, we use <a href="http://software.sil.org/padauk/download/">Padauk</a>, a Unicode-compliant font for all Myanmar languages. If you copy and paste your text into another program, please make sure you are using Padauk there also, or another Unicode font with support for Sgaw Karen characters.</p>
		<p><b>Mobile users :</b> This keyboard is designed for desktop computers. To type in lix wa on your smartphone, <a href="../mobile/">download a Unicode Myanmar keyboard</a> and follow the instructions to switch your phone's keyboard. Then you don't need to use this page.</p>
		<p><b>Other layouts :</b> This keyboard uses a layout from the KarenKNU font.<p>
